# culstring-vt

# Overview
This project focuses on clustering a dataset using DBSCAN and K-means clustering algorithms. The goal is to group similar data points together based on their features.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is 'World_development_mesurement.csv', which contains various development indicators for different countries. The dataset includes features such as Country Name, Country Code, Indicator Name, Indicator Code, and numerical values for each indicator.

# Steps
1)Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical features if necessary.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify potential clusters.

3)Clustering: Use DBSCAN and K-means clustering algorithms to cluster the data points.

4)Cluster Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of clusters using metrics such as silhouette score or inertia.

5)Visualization: Visualize the clusters to understand the grouping of data points.

6)Interpretation: Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the clusters.
